Server 1 (Web Server):

Nginx is installed on this server to handle incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests.
A firewall is configured to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
Server 2 (Application Server):

This server hosts the application code (your code base).
A firewall is configured to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
Server 3 (Database Server):

MySQL is configured to serve as the database.
A firewall is configured to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
Firewalls (3 in total):

Firewalls are added to control and secure traffic between servers and the internet.
They restrict unauthorized access, prevent malicious activities, and enhance overall network security.
SSL Certificate:

An SSL certificate is added to enable HTTPS for www.foobar.com.
It encrypts the data in transit, ensuring secure communication between the user's browser and the web server.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):

Monitoring clients are installed on each server to collect data and send it to a monitoring service (e.g., Sumo Logic).
They capture metrics, logs, and other relevant information to monitor the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure.
Specifics:

Firewalls:

Control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
Prevent unauthorized access, protect against cyber threats, and enhance network security.
SSL Certificate:

Enables HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Secures user data, passwords, and other sensitive information from interception or tampering during transmission.
Monitoring:

Used to proactively identify and address performance issues, security threats, and other anomalies.
Enables real-time and historical analysis of system metrics, logs, and events to ensure optimal performance and security.
Monitoring Data Collection:

Monitoring clients collect data such as system metrics, logs, and events from each server.
Data is sent to a centralized monitoring service, providing a holistic view of the entire infrastructure's health and performance.
Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second):

To monitor web server QPS, set up monitoring tools to track incoming HTTP requests and responses.
Utilize metrics like Nginx request rates and response times to identify patterns, spikes, or anomalies in web server traffic.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can expose unencrypted traffic between the load balancer and the internal servers.
It's recommended to terminate SSL at the application server or use end-to-end encryption to maintain security throughout the entire communication chain.
Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes introduces a single point of failure for write operations.
Implementing a Primary-Replica cluster with MySQL can provide redundancy and improve fault tolerance.
Identical Servers for All Components:

Having servers with identical components may lead to uniform vulnerabilities.
Diversifying server types, versions, or operating systems can mitigate risks associated with common vulnerabilities affecting all servers simultaneously.
