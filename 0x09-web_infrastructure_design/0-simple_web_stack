Server (IP: 8.8.8.8):

The physical or virtual machine responsible for hosting the entire web infrastructure.
Domain Name (www.foobar.com):

A user wanting to access the website first types www.foobar.com into their web browser.
The domain name serves as a human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
DNS Record (www):

The "www" in www.foobar.com is a subdomain and typically represented by a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record pointing to the domain's main record. For example:
objectivec
Copy code
www    IN    CNAME    foobar.com.
Web Server (Nginx):

The web server (Nginx) is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests.
It listens for requests on port 80 and serves static content, manages SSL/TLS termination, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
Application Server:

This server runs the application code (your code base).
It handles dynamic content generation, interacts with the database, and processes business logic.
Common choices for application servers include Gunicorn, uWSGI, or application server modules like mod_wsgi for Apache.
Application Files (Code Base):

The code base consists of the web application files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code (e.g., Python, PHP, Ruby).
These files are stored on the server and are executed by the application server to generate dynamic content.
Database (MySQL):

MySQL is used as the relational database management system (RDBMS).
It stores and retrieves data, allowing the application to persist and manage information.
Communication with User's Computer:

The communication between the server and the user's computer is facilitated through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
When a user requests www.foobar.com, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the appropriate content.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in that server (hardware, software, or network) could lead to downtime for the entire website.
Downtime During Maintenance:

Any maintenance activities, such as deploying new code that requires the web server to be restarted, will result in downtime for the website.
Limited Scalability:

The infrastructure is not easily scalable to handle increased traffic. If traffic spikes, the single server may become a bottleneck, leading to performance issues or downtime.
To address these issues, a more robust infrastructure design would involve distributed systems, load balancing, redundancy, and potentially cloud services to ensure high availability and scalability.
