Server:

A dedicated server that hosts the entire web application infrastructure.
This server acts as the foundation for the web application, providing the necessary resources and hosting components.
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

Configured as a cluster with redundancy for high availability.
Distributes incoming traffic among multiple servers to enhance performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
Web Server:

Responsible for handling HTTP requests, serving static content, and managing SSL/TLS termination.
Nginx is used as the web server to efficiently process and respond to incoming requests.
Application Server:

Hosts the application code and handles dynamic content generation.
Gunicorn is utilized as the application server to execute server-side code and process business logic.
Database:

A separate server is dedicated to hosting the database (e.g., MySQL or another RDBMS).
The database server stores and retrieves data, ensuring persistence for the web application.
Specifics
Load Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster:
Why Add a Load Balancer:
The load balancer distributes incoming traffic, preventing a single server from becoming a bottleneck.
Enhances fault tolerance and scalability by evenly distributing requests among multiple servers.
HAProxy Cluster Configuration:
HAProxy is configured as a cluster to ensure high availability.
Redundancy is established, meaning if one load balancer fails, another can seamlessly take over.
Web Server:
Why Use Nginx as the Web Server:
Nginx is chosen for its efficiency, low resource usage, and high performance.
It excels in serving static content and efficiently handling a large number of concurrent connections.
Application Server:
Why Include an Application Server:
Separating the web server from the application server allows for scalability and efficient resource utilization.
Gunicorn, as the application server, executes server-side code, processes dynamic content, and supports concurrent connections.
Database Server:
Why Separate Database Server:
Isolating the database on its dedicated server enhances security, scalability, and allows for optimized resource allocation.
Provides a centralized location for data storage and retrieval.
